## Introduction

## Description of the dataset and preprocessing steps.
## Methodology for biomarker discovery and machine learning analysis.
Transcriptome profiling and gene expression quantification data for lung adenocarcinoma were downloaded from the LUAD dataset in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The study included 40 samples, consisting of 20 irregular smokers (less than one cigarette per day) and 20 regular smokers (more than three cigarettes per day), all of whom were white individuals with stage 1 tumors. Genes with the lowest expression levels were filtered out for further analysis.
Differential Gene Expression Analysis Between Irregular and Regular Smokers in Lung Adenocarcinoma

Differential gene expression analysis was performed using the TCGA-LUAD dataset to compare irregular and regular smokers with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), a subtype of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) linked to smoking. The TCGAanalyze_DEA function from the TCGAbiolinks package, utilizing the R package edgeR, was used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). LogFC and false discovery rates (FDR) were reported, with FDR > 0.01 and |logFC| > 2 set as inclusion criteria. The `TCGAanalyze_LevelTab` function generated a results table summarizing gene expression across both conditions, revealing how smoking frequency impacts gene regulation in LUAD.

### Gene Function Enrichment Analysis

The DEGs were mapped using the GO database to identify their biological and functional properties. Gene Ontology analysis was performed after converting Ensembl gene IDs to HGNC symbols via the biomaRt package for downstream analysis. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was used to assess the biological significance of upregulated and downregulated genes, employing the TCGAanalyze_EAcomplete function to explore enriched Biological Processes (BP), Molecular Functions (MF), Cellular Components (CC), and pathways.
